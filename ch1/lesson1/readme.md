# Lesson 1: Hello World
File for this lesson: <i>main.rs</i>

Rust syntax looks similar to Java. In the first lesson, we will build a <b>main()</b> function to run <b>println!()</b> as print line. You should put a semi-colon at the end to complete the statement (It would still run without a semi-colon but it is not the best practice).

## File
To begin the journey of learning Rust, the script will print <b>Hello World!</b> to kick off the chapter.

## Running the Script
To execute your Rust script, you need to first compile the script and execute the compiled file, with the following code:

```
rustc main.rs
./main
```

<br>
Note: After you have complied <i>main.rs</i>, <i>main</i> will be created. You need to put <b>./</b> before <i>main</i>, or else it will return an error.
