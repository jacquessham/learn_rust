## Chapter 1: Basic Syntax
In this chapter, we will go over <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">The Book (The Rust Programming Language)</a> to learn the basic syntax in Rust.

## Lesson 1: Hello World
File for this lesson:  <i>main.rs</i><br>
It can be found in the [Lesson 1 Folder](/lesson1)
<br><br>
In Rust, <b>println!()</b> is the print line statement.
<br><br>
Before execute a Rust script, you need to compile the script and run the compiled file afterward. Here is the example to run <i>main.rs</i>:

```
rustc main.rs
./main
```

## Lesson 2: Cargo
